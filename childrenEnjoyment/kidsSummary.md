# kids enjoyment detector
Would it be possible to tell whether kids are enjoying contents or not? This research stems from a very common problem while developing contents especially for children where it is especially difficult to measure engagement. Unlike adults, kids are unlikely to be able to give a useful interview and it may be unethical to use a tougher interrogation method.

An idea to tackle this problem is to develop a deep learning model which looks at a video of human face and predict the degree of engagement.
