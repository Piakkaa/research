# recolor videos
There are many videos that was taken in black&white in the past. These are impossible to recreate and many were taken before color technology was developed. There are also some videos which the color quality is suboptimal due to the technology at the time. I would like to develop a GAN system to color the videos quickly and effectively. Although this practice is already common as evident by the movies [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World\_War\_II\_in\_Colour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II_in_Colour) and many open products. Most of these pictures are enhanced for historical accuracy. However, there are cases where we want to optimize for the emotion encapsulated in the video instead of historical accuracy. I believe that this may be more interesting and useful in some kind of movies.
